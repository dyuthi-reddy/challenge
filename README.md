Programming Challenge

Instructions

Fork this repository and implement the simulation scenario as described below. Try to show your process and write clean, robust, tested code. You may complete the challenge using Java or Javascript, but please describe your approach and anything we may need to know in the results.md file.

Scenario

Acme Lottery Co. is developing a new Lottery Machine that will dispense different types of lottery tickets to customers. Your job is to write code to simulate one complete sale cycle and drawing of the Lottery Machine's functionality to provide insight for company executives.

The Lottery Machine

The Lottery Machine is capable of producing Pick 3, Pick 4, or Pick 5 tickets. See below for a description of the different ticket types.
Additional ticket types will be introduced in the future, but not for this simulation.
The price of the tickets is irrelevant for this simulation.
Assume that the Lottery Machine starts out completely full.
Once the Lottery Machine is empty (i.e. no tickets of any type remain), a drawing will be held. See below for drawing rules.
Customers

Customers may want to purchase between 1 and 5 lottery tickets.
A customer is equally likely to intend to purchase any type of lottery ticket.
If the ticket type that a customer intended to purchase is sold out, they will attempt to purchase another type at random.
Customers will continue to show up until the machine is empty.
All customers will be available at the drawing. (i.e., the drawing can check all customers for the winners)
Each customer can be uniquely identified. (e.g., name or ID)
Drawing

A drawing consists of picking a winning ticket for each ticket type the Lottery Machine is capable of producing.
For each ticket type, the Lottery Machine randomly picks a number it has generated with the appropriate amount of digits. This is used to declare the winning ticket.
A customer is a winner if they have a winning ticket.
A customer may be the winner for more than one ticket type.
Lottery Ticket Types & Rules

Pick 3

A customer buys a ticket with a single random 3 digit number (e.g. 345) chosen by the Lottery Machine.
Valid digits are 0-9.
No two tickets will have the same 3 digit number.
The Lottery Machine is capable of holding 50 Pick 3 tickets.
Pick 4

A customer buys a ticket with a single random 4 digit number (e.g. 1927) chosen by the Lottery Machine.
Valid digits are 0-9.
No two tickets will have the same 4 digit number.
The Lottery Machine is capable of holding 40 Pick 4 tickets.
Pick 5

A customer buys a ticket with a single random 5 digit number (e.g. 03456) chosen by the Lottery Machine.
Valid digits are 0-9.
No two tickets will have the same 5 digit number.
The Lottery Machine is capable of holding 60 Pick 5 tickets.
Deliverables

Simulation Integrity

The Lottery Machine should guard against producing invalid ticket data.
The Lottery Machine should always choose a valid winner during drawings.
Simulation Reporting

Have the simulation report the following:

How many customers purchased tickets?
What type of tickets did each customer purchase?
Did customers attempt to purchase sold out ticket types?
Which customers won the drawing for each ticket type?
Which numbers were selected during the drawing?
