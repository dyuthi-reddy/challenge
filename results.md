Implemented the Challange from https://github.com/nischallenge/challenge.

The project is built with maven (Build automation), spring (MVC), Java, Jsp, Servlets, CSS, Bootstrap and HTML.

The project is built using eclipse IDE and I have used Apache Tomcat8 server for testing purposes.
I have used mockito for unit testing, but only 30% code coverage is presented.

As the project is built with maven, there is no need to download jars for spring and jstl.

To run the project please install egit in your eclipse from the market place.
go to import -> select git -> cloneURI.
coopy the URI link from GITHUb or paste this link:  https://github.com/dyuthi-reddy/challenge.
After import the git repository for the project. run the project on server. Make sure that the URL of the application is 
http://localhost:8080/AcmeLotteryco/
follow the application from here on.

if you would like to draw the lottery winner.

please go to http://localhost:8080/AcmeLotteryco/draw url and follow the application from there.

for ease of execution for you the application doesnot have a database or it does not make use of hibernate or any other tools.
